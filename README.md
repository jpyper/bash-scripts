# bash-scripts

This repository contains some BASH scipts that I have made over the years. I have found them useful in my day to day operations and feel they are at a point where I can share them with the world. They may not be perfect, and they may not follow the BASH scripting directives, but they work for what I need them to do.

# flac2mp3.sh

This is a simple script that takes input FLAC file(s) in a directory and creates output MP3 file(s). Commonly used to convert high quality lossless FLAC audio to high quality lossy MP3 audio for portable music players and devices that do not support the FLAC file format.

# webaom.sh

This is a simple script that downloads webaom.jnlp from static.anidb.net and runs the client locally. Since the script always downloads the webaom.jnlp file each time it is run, it will make sure you are running the latest version of the java client (even though it hasn't been updated in ages).

# How can you help?

I know my scripting practices do not follow any sort of guidelines. For the most part, these scripts are just slapped together with lots of duct tape keeping them from falling apart.

If you have suggestions on better ways of making a task work or easier ways of structuring the code, please file a bug against the script in question with your suggestion.
